Learn how to properly secure web applications by implementing measures like input validation, secure session management, and proper error handling.

d) Advanced Network Attacks
Study network attacks like DNS spoofing, ARP poisoning, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), and BGP hijacking.

Explore tools like Wireshark (for network analysis) and Ettercap (for MITM attacks).

Packet Crafting: Learn how to create custom packets to exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols.

9. Setting Up Your Lab for Practical Experience
Creating a well-equipped, isolated virtual lab is essential for safely practicing ethical hacking, malware analysis, and penetration testing.

Steps to Set Up Your Lab:
Install Virtualization Software: Use VirtualBox or VMware to create virtual machines (VMs). This helps isolate the virtual machines, so you can safely test malware and hacking techniques without risking your host system.

Use Kali Linux: Kali is a must-have for ethical hackers because it comes with pre-installed penetration testing tools like Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, etc.

Install Other Security VMs: Set up other VMs for specific testing, such as a vulnerable target machine like Metasploitable, OWASP Juice Shop, or DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application).

Create a Windows VM: Many attacks work on Windows-based systems, so having a Windows VM is essential for testing malware or exploitation techniques that target Microsoft systems.

Network Configuration: Use an isolated network in VirtualBox or VMware to prevent your VMs from connecting to the outside world and putting your host system at risk.

Tools to Install in Your Lab:
Burp Suite: For web application security testing.

Metasploit: For penetration testing and exploit development.
